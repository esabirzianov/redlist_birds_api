## Introduction
EBird is a global platform and database of bird observations providing scientists, researchers and amateur naturalists with data on the distribution and abundance of birds.
These observations are recorded in the format of checklists, which include the place of observation, date and time, bird species and their number.

## Goal of project
Create a convenient Web Api to simplify the work of nature protection organizations.

## Functional
BirdInformationController collects data from the eBird API about rare birds and outputs them to the user. It is also possible to filter observations by a certain type, delete them, change and add new ones.

Red List Controller allows you to view the list of birds listed in the Red Book and displays information about the latest sightings of these species.

All actions in HTTP requests are integrated with the Database.

## Notes
This project displays information only for the Turkey region.
